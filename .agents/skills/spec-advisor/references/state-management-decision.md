# State Management Decision

The most common frontend architecture mistake is treating all state as one thing. It is not. Classify state first, then pick tools per class. A single app routinely uses three or four state mechanisms, and that is correct — not over-engineering.

## Step 1: Classify the State

| Class                   | Nature                                              | Examples                                                   | Owned by                  |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Server state**        | Remote, async, cached, shared truth lives elsewhere | user profile, product list, posts                          | Data-fetching layer       |
| **Client global state** | Local, synchronous, shared across the tree          | theme, auth session flag, open modals, cart (pre-checkout) | Client store / Context    |
| **Local state**         | Confined to one component subtree                   | input value, hover, accordion open                         | `useState` / `useReducer` |
| **URL state**           | Belongs in the address bar, shareable/bookmarkable  | filters, pagination, active tab, search query              | Router search params      |
| **Form state**          | Transient editing state with validation             | field values, errors, dirty/touched                        | Form library              |

The decisive question for each piece of state: **"Where is the source of truth?"** If it's on a server, it's server state — do not copy it into a client store.

## Step 2: Pick Tools Per Class

### Server state

Use a caching data layer, never a plain global store:

- **TanStack Query** (default for client-driven fetching) — caching, background refetch, mutations, invalidation.
- **SWR** — lighter, hook-first, simpler needs.
- **RSC + server actions** (Next App Router) — fetch on the server, pass down; add TanStack Query only where rich client caching is needed.
- GraphQL → **Apollo / urql** with their normalized caches.

### Client global state — decision tree

```
Is it actually local to one subtree?
  └─ yes → useState / useReducer (stop here)
Is it server data?
  └─ yes → server state layer, NOT a store (stop here)
Does it belong in the URL?
  └─ yes → router search params (stop here)
Is it low-frequency, simple shared state (theme, auth flag)?
  └─ yes → Context (split providers per concern to limit re-renders)
Is it frequently updated or accessed across a wide tree?
  ├─ want minimal API, single store    → Zustand
  ├─ want atomic / bottom-up, fine-grained subscriptions → Jotai
  └─ large app, complex async flows, middleware/devtools, team familiarity → Redux Toolkit
```

### Local state

`useState` for simple values; `useReducer` when transitions are interrelated or state-machine-like. Prefer deriving values during render over syncing them with effects.

### URL state

Filters, pagination, sort, active tab, search term → store in the router's search params (`useSearchParams`, TanStack Router typed search). Benefits: shareable, bookmarkable, survives refresh, back/forward works. Avoid duplicating it into a client store.

### Form state

Owned by the form library (React Hook Form / TanStack Form). Do not lift every keystroke into global state; submit results may become server state (via a mutation) or client state.

## Step 3: Common Anti-patterns to Flag

- Server data cached in Redux/Zustand → cache duplication, staleness, manual sync. Move to a data layer.
- Everything in one global store → re-render storms, coupling. Split by class and concern.
- Context for high-frequency state → re-renders every consumer. Use Zustand/Jotai instead.
- Filters/tabs in client state instead of the URL → loses shareability and refresh persistence.
- `useEffect` to copy props/server data into local state → derive during render or use the data layer.

## Output for spec-advisor

Produce an explicit **state strategy summary**:

| State class   | Concrete examples in this app | Chosen mechanism                |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Server        | ...                           | TanStack Query / RSC            |
| Client global | ...                           | Context / Zustand / Jotai / RTK |
| Local         | ...                           | useState / useReducer           |
| URL           | ...                           | router search params            |
| Form          | ...                           | React Hook Form + Zod           |

Pass this to `architecture-design`, which decides _where_ each store/provider physically lives in the boundary and folder structure.
