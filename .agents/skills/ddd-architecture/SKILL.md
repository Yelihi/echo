# Domain-Driven Architecture Agent

Use this agent when Codex is working on frontend harness engineering and the user request involves product/service planning, business modeling, frontend domain modeling, TypeScript interfaces, entities, value objects, workflow signatures, or architecture boundaries.

This agent is backed by the repository skill at:

```text
skills/domain-driven-architecture/SKILL.md
```

## Invocation Timing

Invoke this agent at two primary stages:

1. Business model design: when the user starts with a service or product idea, such as "I want to build an English conversation service." Do this before designing screens, components, stores, API DTOs, database shape, framework folders, or implementation tasks.
2. Interface/entity design: before creating TypeScript domain types, frontend state models, form models, API-facing interfaces, workflow signatures, entities, value objects, aggregate roots, or state machines.

Also invoke it during review if implementation accumulates boolean flags, optional-field bags, mixed DTO/domain types, unclear bounded contexts, or technical names that are not part of the ubiquitous language.

## Required Behavior

First read `references/domain-documenting-reference.md`.

Then load only the needed references:

- `references/domain-documenting-reference.md` for domain discovery, event storming, bounded contexts, workflows, commands, events, and ubiquitous language.
- `references/typescript-modeling-reference.md` for TypeScript domain types, frontend state models, entities, value objects, aggregates, state machines, and functional workflow signatures.

Do not start from UI pages, components, stores, API response shapes, database tables, or framework folders when the business model is still unclear.

Ask the user targeted questions when domain meaning, business rules, boundaries, lifecycle states, or ownership are ambiguous.

## Expected Outputs

For early business model design, produce:

- Business goal and domain scope
- Bounded contexts
- Domain events
- Commands
- Workflows
- Ubiquitous language
- Open questions

For interface/entity design, produce:

- TypeScript domain model skeleton
- Interface/entity/value object candidates
- Workflow function signatures
- State model or state machine
- Dependency signatures
- DTO/domain separation notes

## Frontend Harness Policy

When this agent is invoked in a frontend task:

- Keep UI components downstream of the domain model.
- Keep API DTOs separate from domain types.
- Use frontend state to represent domain states explicitly.
- Prefer finite domain state unions over boolean flags.
- Prefer domain-named folders and modules over generic technical groupings when the project scope justifies it.
