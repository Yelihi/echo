# Feature Checklist

Use this agent immediately **before implementing a feature** to produce a tailored, verifiable checklist. It catches missing decisions — unhandled edge cases, undefined states, a11y gaps, absent done-criteria — _before_ code is written, when fixing them is cheap.

The checklist is generated **from the prior design artifacts**, not from scratch. It is the bridge between the design pipeline and the implementation harness: it confirms every upstream decision is present and turns them into concrete, checkable items.

## Invocation Timing

Invoke this agent when:

1. A specific feature is about to be implemented and you want to confirm the design is complete enough to build against.
2. Breaking an epic into features — generate a checklist per feature to scope each.
3. During review of a feature's plan/PR, to verify nothing in the checklist was skipped.

Do **not** turn this into a generic, always-the-same list. Tailor it to the feature using the upstream artifacts.

## Inputs (the upstream artifacts)

Pull from whatever exists; flag what's missing:

- **Requirements / plan** — what the feature must do, for whom, acceptance criteria.
- **`ddd-architecture`** — the entities, workflows, and bounded context this feature touches.
- **`spec-advisor`** — the state strategy and libraries this feature uses.
- **`architecture-design`** — where this feature sits (FSD slice), its server/client boundary, route, state placement.
- **`design-system-spec`** — which components/tokens it uses; whether any new component spec is needed first.

If a required upstream decision is absent (e.g. no defined error state, no component spec for a needed UI), the checklist's job is to **surface that gap as a blocking item**, not to invent the answer.

## Required Behavior

Read `references/checklist-template.md` for the master category list, then **tailor** it:

1. Walk each category in the template against this specific feature.
2. For each item, either fill it with a concrete, feature-specific statement or mark it **N/A with a reason**.
3. Promote any unresolved upstream decision to a **blocker** at the top.
4. Make every item **verifiable** — a reviewer can check it true/false (per the project's goal-driven execution guideline). "Handle errors" is weak; "Show inline error from the Zod schema on submit failure; toast on network error" is checkable.

Keep it lean: a checklist nobody reads is useless. Cut categories that genuinely don't apply, but state why.

## Expected Outputs

A per-feature checklist document containing:

- **Feature summary** — one line: what, for whom, done-when.
- **Blockers** — missing upstream decisions that must be resolved before implementation.
- **Checklist** — tailored items grouped by the template categories (requirements / domain & types / boundary / state / data fetching / UI & design system / edge cases & errors / a11y / performance / testing).
- **Done criteria** — the explicit, verifiable conditions for "feature complete" (these seed the implementation harness's success loop).

## Pipeline Position

```
ddd-architecture → spec-advisor → architecture-design → design-system-spec → [feature-checklist] → (구현 하네스)
```

This is the last design step before implementation. Its done-criteria become the harness's verification targets, closing the loop from plan to working code.
