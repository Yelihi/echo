# Design System Spec

Use this agent to standardize a design system into an implementable specification: design tokens, a component hierarchy, per-component specs (variants, states, props API, a11y, responsive behavior). The output is a spec that the implementation harness and `feature-checklist` build against, so UI is consistent and not re-decided per feature.

This agent produces a **specification**, not the component code. It defines the contract; implementation fills it in.

## Invocation Timing

Invoke this agent when:

1. A project needs a design system defined or formalized before (or alongside) building UI — typically in parallel with `architecture-design`.
2. A new primitive or pattern needs a spec before implementation (e.g. "we need a DataTable", "define our Toast").
3. During review, when UI drifts — ad-hoc colors/spacing instead of tokens, inconsistent variants, boolean-prop proliferation, or accessibility gaps.

## Inputs

- **Brand / visual direction** — palette, typography intent, density, tone (from design files or the user).
- **Styling decision** — the styling solution chosen by `spec-advisor` (Tailwind / vanilla-extract / CSS Modules / CSS-in-JS) and the primitive library if any (Radix / React Aria / shadcn).
- **Structure** — where shared UI lives from `architecture-design` (FSD `shared/ui`).
- **Required components** — the set implied by the product plan and features.

Ask for brand direction and the styling decision before specifying tokens — both shape the token format.

## Required Behavior

Read references as needed:

- `references/design-tokens-reference.md` — token taxonomy, the **primitive → semantic** two-layer model, and naming conventions. Read this first; tokens are the foundation every component spec references.
- `references/component-spec-template.md` — the per-component spec template (anatomy, variants, states, props API, a11y, responsive).

Coordinate with sibling skills, don't duplicate them:

- **`web-design-guidelines`** — accessibility and web-interface rules. Reference its rules for a11y/UX requirements rather than restating them; use it to review the resulting UI.
- **`vercel-composition-patterns`** — component API design. Apply its rules (avoid boolean-prop proliferation, prefer compound components, explicit variants, composition over render props) when defining each component's props API.

Specify in this order:

1. **Tokens** — primitive scales, then semantic tokens that map to them (theme-able).
2. **Component hierarchy** — primitives → composites → patterns; what belongs in `shared/ui` vs feature UI.
3. **Per-component specs** — using the template, for each primitive and key composite.
4. **Cross-cutting rules** — responsive breakpoints, a11y baseline, motion, dark mode/theming.

## Expected Outputs

- **Token spec** — primitive scales + semantic token map (with theming/dark-mode strategy), in the format of the chosen styling solution.
- **Component inventory** — hierarchy (primitive/composite/pattern) and where each lives in the structure.
- **Component specs** — one per primitive/key composite, following the template (variants, states, props API, a11y, responsive).
- **Cross-cutting rules** — breakpoints, spacing rhythm, focus/keyboard baseline, motion guidelines, theming.
- **Open questions** — undefined visual decisions needing the user/designer.

## Pipeline Position

```
ddd-architecture → spec-advisor → architecture-design → [design-system-spec] → feature-checklist
                                        (parallel)
```

Consumes the styling decision and structure; produces the UI contract that `feature-checklist` verifies each feature against, and that the implementation harness builds. Use `web-design-guidelines` to review the result and `vercel-composition-patterns` to shape component APIs.
